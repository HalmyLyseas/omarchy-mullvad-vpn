# Developer notes

## Architecture

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | Declares the `service` and `bar-widget` entry points and keeps the service loaded across widget reloads. |
| `Service.qml` | Owns shared Mullvad state, polling, the status listener, action queues, read-only System diagnostics, deadlines, output bounds, and excluded-process resolution. |
| `BarWidget.qml` | Resolves only this plugin's service through the scoped bar facade, renders state, and loads `Panel.qml` while the service exists. |
| `Panel.qml` | Implements Connection (search, favourites, recents, map, relay filters), Advanced (connection policy, DNS, anti-censorship), Excluded, and System (account and diagnostics). Connection and System remain available without the CLI or daemon; with a running daemon and no login, only System is available. It receives the service from `BarWidget.qml`; it does not search host registries. |
| `Model.js` | Contains pure parsing, validation, redaction, grouping, bounded diagnostic parsing, desktop-entry search, recent-ID normalization, and fixed argv construction. |
| `WorldMap.qml` / `NaturalEarthMap.qml` | Render the interactive offline Connection map and bundled 1:50m land and country-boundary shapes. |
| `scripts/mullvad-package-info` | Reads bounded metadata for the two allowlisted Mullvad packages from pacman's local database without running a package manager. |
| `scripts/mullvad-update-check` | Runs only `checkupdates`, filters and bounds Mullvad results, and applies its own TERM/KILL timeout. |

The System page contains account login and logout plus diagnostics. Account actions require a working Mullvad CLI and daemon, and login passes the account number over stdin without saving it. A confirmed logout routes the panel to System and disables the other tabs; successful login unlocks them. System displays account errors and offers a Disconnect button if a tunnel remains active. Tunnel connect and relay-selection follow-up actions reject a confirmed logout in the service, including IPC and bar shortcuts. Periodic status refreshes also query account state so external login and logout are eventually reflected. Failed or unrecognized account reads preserve the last confirmed account state; while state is unknown, controls remain available and the CLI decides whether actions can succeed. Account reads started before login or logout completion cannot overwrite the resulting state. System has no installer, package-update action, privilege escalation, or application-launch path. Package metadata reads are local; the optional automatic/manual update check is the sole network-capable diagnostic.

## Omarchy 4.0.4 facade

A third-party `bar-widget` receives a scoped facade. `serviceFor("halmylyseas.mullvad-vpn")` may resolve the plugin service; foreign service IDs must return `null`. The facade's `appLibrary` is `null` because the manifest does not declare `kind: "menu"`. The plugin does not traverse parent objects, private service registries, or replacement-bar internals to escape this boundary.

Excluded-app discovery uses the public Quickshell `DesktopEntries` catalogue. Search scans at most 4,096 entries, caps keyword count at 64, and bounds every searchable field before concatenation. Standard `noDisplay` entries are filtered. Omarchy's private launcher-hide configuration is not available through the scoped facade. Empty search shows resolved recent desktop IDs, while a non-empty query searches the bounded local catalogue. Launch execution remains the fixed argv returned by `Model.argv("launchExcluded", ...)`; safe desktop IDs may contain spaces and parentheses, while path syntax and shell metacharacters remain rejected. The panel persists the recent ID and closes only when the service reports that dispatch succeeded.

Settings persistence clones the current inline settings and replaces only favourites, recent locations, and recent excluded desktop IDs. This preserves unrelated values such as `refreshIntervalSec`.

The map's 1000×500 equirectangular geometry comes from Natural Earth's public-domain 1:50m land and international-boundary GeoJSON. `python scripts/generate-map-shapes.py` regenerates `NaturalEarthMap.qml` from a pinned Natural Earth vector commit, simplifying coordinates by 0.3 map units; the network is used only when regenerating source data. Runtime map interactions do not fetch tiles or geocode locations. `WorldMap.qml` keeps the camera between the world view and 10× zoom, and the target-location animation returns to 6× zoom. Markers remain screen-sized while the map pans and scales.

## Service and widget lifecycle

`manifest.json` keeps `Service.qml` loaded while per-monitor bar widgets may reload. A new widget must resolve and inject the existing service instance. The panel loader is active only while the scoped service exists, so removing or replacing the facade destroys a stale panel. A host that does not expose the plugin service renders `Mullvad controls unavailable in this bar`; it does not attempt a private lookup.

When testing an installed change to `Service.qml`, use a full `omarchy restart shell`. A rescan or widget hot reload is insufficient.

## Process contract

Every `mullvad` command is a direct Quickshell child with argv created by `Model.argv`. Read and action queues enforce deadlines and bounded output. The long-lived status listener rejects over-limit unterminated output and cannot be overwritten by an older delayed poll. Account login writes the number to the direct child's stdin, closes stdin, and never stores or logs the value. Excluded-application launch is the only fire-and-forget path and still uses fixed argv.

System package metadata uses the normal bounded read queue and is collected even when the CLI probe fails. Daemon version and support come from `mullvad version`; `pgrep -x mullvad-daemon` supplies a PID when available. `checkupdates` runs through a dedicated `Process` that is excluded from `busy`, so a slow check cannot block VPN controls. Attempts are debounced for 60 seconds, automatic checks run after the startup grace period and then hourly, and both the helper and service process have bounded output plus TERM/KILL watchdogs. Failed checks preserve the last successful result and timestamp. The helper bounds `checkupdates` output through a pipe rather than `ulimit -f`: a file-size limit is inherited by pacman and kills its repository database sync with SIGXFSZ.

The service's six private stdout/stderr arrays are imperative buffers, consumed by finalizers rather than reactive UI bindings. Appends mutate these arrays in place; reset replaces them. Keep output counters, redaction, tail flushing, overflow termination, and watchdogs independent of array change notifications.

## Public IPC

The target is `halmylyseas.mullvad-vpn`. Besides panel navigation, status, tunnel actions, excluded groups, and favourites, it exposes:

- `lockdown("on"|"off")`: dispatches the fixed lockdown setter and returns `ok`. Invalid values return `invalid lockdown mode` without dispatch. As with the existing tunnel IPC methods, `ok` acknowledges the request, not command completion; readiness failures appear in service feedback.
- `checkUpdates()`: invokes the debounced read-only update check and returns its current status. It does not install updates.
- `systemInfo()`: JSON with `cliVersion`, `cliVersionSupported`, `lockdown`, `daemonVersion`, `daemonSupported`, `suggestedUpgrade`, `daemonRunning`, `daemonPid`, `packages`, `updateCheckStatus`, `updateCheckedAt`, `updateAvailable`, and `updateTargets`.

The service stores update results as bounded display strings; IPC maps them back to `{ name, current, latest }` target objects. `updateAvailable` reflects the last successful results even after a failed check, so consumers must consult status and timestamp. Package objects preserve `name`, `version`, ISO UTC `installedAt`, and `buildAt`, and add `description`. Missing or invalid timestamps are empty strings. The local helper carries the original epoch fields alongside the panel's formatted install date so IPC does not round or reinterpret local time. System diagnostics remain read-only.

See [the threat model](threat-model.md) for trust boundaries and residual risks.

## Local dropdown controls

`OmaDropdown.qml` and `OmaSearchableDropdown.qml` are local MIT-licensed Omarchy controls with corrected trigger-click closing. They use the host kit's focus, hover-cursor, and popup styling rather than a native ComboBox. Both accept strings or `{ value, label }` option objects; the searchable control also accepts `description` and filters labels and descriptions case-insensitively. Closing its popup clears the filter.

Tab focuses a trigger; Enter/Space opens it. In the plain dropdown, j/k or Up/Down moves between options and Enter selects. The searchable control focuses its filter on open; Down moves into results and Up from the first result returns to the filter. Escape closes either popup. Parent panels use `popupOpen` to suspend their own key catcher while a popup owns input, and `hovered(bool)` to synchronize cursor styling.

## Validation

Run the complete local gate from the repository root:

```bash
bash tests/ci-local
```

Use `bash tests/ci-local --no-cage` only as a live-session fallback when Cage cannot be used.

The gate runs:

1. QML lint and manifest validation.
2. `node --test tests/*.test.js` for pure model and sink checks.
3. `tests/run-cli-contract`, which runs the read-only CLI contract against an inert test-local `mullvad` mock and verifies its exact argv inventory.
4. `tests/probe/run` for mocked process, timeout, output-limit, listener, race, grouping, package metadata, and isolated read-only update-check behavior.
5. `tests/probe/run-ui` against the real `BarWidget.qml` and `Panel.qml`, including System availability without the CLI or daemon, under the selected Omarchy shell source.
6. `tests/quicktest/run`, which drives real `QtTest.TestCase` keyboard and pointer events through Panel routing, both dropdowns, confirmation dialogs, and WorldMap markers under the Cage gate.
7. `tests/probe/run-settings` against the current scoped host facade and an isolated `shell.json`.
8. Node tests, runner/mock syntax, QML lint, and manifest validation again from a clean archive of the proposed index.

The physical-input suite requires `qmltestrunner`, provided on Arch by `qt6-declarative` at `/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmltestrunner`. The runner first accepts `command -v qmltestrunner`, then checks that explicit Arch path, and fails closed when neither is available.

The probe suites mock all VPN-changing commands, `checkupdates`, process lookup, and excluded-application launch; they must not mutate the live daemon or invoke a real package manager or network update check. CI clones exact Omarchy `v4.0.4` and runs the gate against its `shell/` and `bin/omarchy-plugin-validate`. Local validation defaults to `/usr/share/omarchy/shell` and the installed `omarchy-plugin-validate`; set `OMARCHY_SHELL_DIR` and `OMARCHY_PLUGIN_VALIDATOR` to test another source tree.

## Release discipline

Update release metadata in a focused commit after the behavior and documentation gates pass. Publish only an exact reviewed SHA, compare the remote ref with that SHA, and require the corresponding Actions run to succeed before tagging or requesting marketplace verification.
